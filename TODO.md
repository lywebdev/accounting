## AccountingApp TODO (current sprint)

- [ ] Reporting UI: build Blazor pages (MudTabs/tables) for Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, Trial Balance, and General Ledger; hook them up to `ReportingService` filters and add localization strings.
- [ ] Export features: add PDF/CSV export endpoints for invoices and VAT declarations, including UI buttons and localization.
- [ ] Banking polish: optionally surface auto-match logs/snackbar per transaction and add filters for journaled vs non-journaled items.
